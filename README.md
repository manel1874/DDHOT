# DDHOT
Implementation of OT under DDH assumption based on the following work: "A Framework for Efficient and Composable Oblivious Transfer"

There are two possible setup modes:

- SetupMessy:
  o Receiver'security: computational
  o Sender's security: statistical
- SetupDec:
  o Receiver's security: statistical
  o Sender'security: computational
